# SkyDecoder

An application for decoding the contents of astronomical images.

## Introduction

SkyDecoder is a Python application intended to label objects in astronomical images. It is a
stand-alone application, not a desktop application.

At the moment, SkyDecoder is in the very early stages of development. The application is not yet
functional in any meaningful way. I have to start somewhere!

## About Me

I'm just a nerdy girl who loves astronomy, photography, and coding. This project is my first
attempt at writing something real.
