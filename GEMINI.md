# GEMINI Workspace Context

## 1. Project Environment

This project is currently a **Python** placeholder and learning project.

* **Dependency Management:** We use a combination of `pyproject.toml` (for build/metadata) and
  `environment.yaml` (for environment/dependency definition).
  
* **Primary Language:** Python 3.13+

* **Project Goal:** The immediate goal is to develop a small command-line utility for processing
  images of astronomical objects. Secondly, this project is intended to serve as a learning
  vehicle for its one developer.

## 2. Developer Context (IMPORTANT)

**I am a student developer and relatively inexperienced with modern professional tooling and
complex code patterns.**

* **Experience Level:** Beginner/Intermediate. I have used Python before but am still learning
  best practices and advanced techniques.

* **Instructional Preference:**
    * Please use a **positive, patient, and supportive tone.**
    * **Always explain the 'why'** behind a suggested code fix or pattern.
    * When suggesting code, prioritize **clarity and readability** over maximum performance or complexity.
    * Feel free to point out any "best practices" or Pythonic approaches I may be missing.

## 3. Exclusion Rules

Please **ignore** the contents of the following files/directories unless explicitly referenced:

* `.git/`
* `__pycache__/`
* `venv/`
